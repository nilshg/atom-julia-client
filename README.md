# Julia Client

[![Chat](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/JunoLab/Juno)

Julia client provides interactive IDE-like features for the Atom editor. You can spin up
a Julia process to run in the background, evaluate code inline, get live autocompletion
results, work with the inline console, and more.

For set up instructions, please see [the manual](manual/). This software is very much in
alpha stage so expect to get your hands a little dirty.

We are testing bundled versions of Juno which include Atom, Julia, and the various required packages. Get them here:

* [Windows x64](https://github.com/JunoLab/atom/releases/download/0.3.0/JunoSetup.exe)
* [OS X](https://github.com/JunoLab/atom/releases/download/0.3.0/Juno.zip)
