# Julia Client

Julia client provides interactive IDE-like features for the Atom editor. You can spin up
a Julia process to run in the background, evaluate code inline, get live autocompletion
results, work with the inline console, and more.

For set up instructions, please see [the manual](manual/). This software is very much in
alpha stage so expect to get your hands a little dirty.

We are testing bundled versions of Juno which include Atom, Julia, and the various required packages. Get them here:
